      <p>The technical skilled educational institutions were started in 1943, by the name "Occupational Institutes".
        Later, these are renamed as "Polytechnics"(multiple technical skills/many technical skills). 
        All these Polytechnics were working under "Public Instruction Department".
        As the number of Polytechnics and Technical degree colleges were increased, the new department called "Department of Technical Education " came into existance in 1959.</p>
